# OPG Rudic

This web-site is created as a part of a seminar on _Human-Computer Interaction_ course.

---

### General Info

The initial idea is to make something useful for a seminar paper. That's why I choose to create a page with which my family will present agricultural products from the family farm.

Products, olive oil and almonds are presented on the front page. The family farm is presented, too. Also, on each part, there is a possibility to contact.

All parts of the site are not functional, but they are planned to be completed!

### Techologies and Demo

**Next.js** is used and it is deployed on **Vercel**, [OPGRudic](https://opg-rudic.vercel.app/).
